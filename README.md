This repository is for an exploratory tennis data project based on

main.py will contain a script to calculate the "clutchness" based on Jeff Sackmann's leverage algorithm and then track first and second serve percentage as an indicator of performance. I would like to use this to visualize how well correlated this single indicator of clutch performance is with overall performance as determined by a playerâ€™s ranking.
